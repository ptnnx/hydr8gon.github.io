NooDS provides automatic builds of the latest code every time it's updated. You can grab builds for Windows, macOS, Linux, Switch, and Android [here](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/NooDS/actions). Unfortunately, you need to be signed in with a GitHub account before the download links are accessible. Once you're signed in, click whatever's at the top of the list and download the artifact for your preferred system.

If you're looking for my other emulators, NoiES has a few releases that can be found [here](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/NoiES/releases) for Linux and Switch. CHIP-GR8 only officially supports Linux and will have to be compiled manually.
