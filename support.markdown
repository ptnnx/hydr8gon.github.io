The source code for all of my projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Hydr8gon). If you've found a bug, feel free to leave an issue report if one hasn't already been created. If you're looking for general support, or are just interested in keeping up with development, come join us on the [NooDS Discord](https://discord.gg/JbNz7y4)! As long as I'm not sleeping, I'll usually be around to chat.

For those of you that are feeling generous and want to support me, you can throw a dollar or two at my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/Hydr8gon). This is by no means necessary, but I always appreciate it! I will always try to keep my projects free and ad-free.
