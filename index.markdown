Heyo! Welcome to my blog. I'm a developer who's always been fascinated by emulation. One day I decided to learn what makes emulators tick, and since then I've been working on my very own emulation projects in my spare time. Feel free to look around; I'm just having fun, but I document my progress here, and if you like what you see you can always try my stuff out for yourself!
